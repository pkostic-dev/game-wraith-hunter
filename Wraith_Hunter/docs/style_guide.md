# Style Guide

All of the scripts in this project should have [GDScript documentation comments](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_documentation_comments.html). The documentation that is generated with these comments can be accessed inside of Godot by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> and typing the name of the script in the search bar (e.g. "swipe_listener.gd").  

All of the scripts should follow the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

In order to make the code easier to debug, use [Static typing in GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html) for variables, constants, functions, parameters and return types.
