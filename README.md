## About

Made in [Godot 4](https://www.godotengine.org) using GDScript. This game uses 
binaural audio, haptic feedback, and the gyroscope sensor for gameplay. It also 
uses the touchscreen for controls. Debug controls allow testing on a computer by simulating touch controls and the gyroscope using the mouse and 
keyboard.

:warning: The game is currently still in the development stage.
